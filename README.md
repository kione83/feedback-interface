# feedback-interface
A simple feedback app that can be added to a webpage


This was built following a tutorial as I was learning how to set up and work with the Svelte framework. 
This is a step-by-step following of the following link, and all credit goes to the original creator. I have not yet made my own edits, and will likely not be using this application in the future as it was meant to be a learning stop for me.
